** Write a java program to perform different types of sorting
on array. Give options to user as follows:
1. Press 1 to perform bubble sort in ascending order
2. Press 2 to perform selection sort in ascending order
3. Press 3 to perform insertion sort in ascending order
4. Press 4 to perform bubble sort in descending order
5. Press 5 to perform selection sort in descending order
6. Press 6 to perform insertion sort in descending order
Note: All sorting logics should be present in the static methods
as follows:
1. bubble sort in ascending order – bubbleSortAsc()
2. selection sort in ascending order – selectionSortAsc()
3. insertion sort in ascending order – insertionSortAsc()
4. bubble sort in descending order – bubbleSortDesc()
5. selection sort in descending order – selectionSortDesc()
6. insertion sort in descending order – insertionSortDesc()
